## Tips

1. Due to security reasons, the source code will not be uploaded to GitHub. Please go to [Release](https://github.com/cxw620/BiliRoaming-Rust-Server/releases) for pre-compiled executable file.

2. The server will never **send** any information anywhere except the official Bilibili API, roaming blacklist API and any API set in the configuration file, but add some remote-controlled features (passive timing or active triggering to obtain special configuration) to deal with emergencies, etc. If you worry about any risks, please go to [pchpub/BiliRoaming-Rust-Server](https://github.com/pchpub/BiliRoaming-Rust-Server) to get the open source version. However, we need to remind you that like Go or PHP version, [pchpub/BiliRoaming-Rust-Server](https://github.com/pchpub/BiliRoaming-Rust-Server) uses an old version of the API of Bilibili, which may be officially shut down in short future, though [pchpub/BiliRoaming-Rust-Server](https://github.com/pchpub/BiliRoaming-Rust-Server) may not be maintained in time. Please use BiliRoaming Go version instead which may be maintained in time. or PHP version.
